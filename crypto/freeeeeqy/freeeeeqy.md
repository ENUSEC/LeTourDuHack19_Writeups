## Solution
This challenge takes the crypto.txt file.

Within this it has a data dump of ascii characters.

By running a frequency analysis on it you will get different numbers for different characters.

if you order the frequency analysis from a - z and treat the freqeuncy you get for each character as an ascii code.

You will get the flag.
