# Regex_4_noobs

## Solution
This challenge just follows regex patterns.

Each line tells the user that the flag must match the particular regex query.

The first 2 lines give exact characters revelaing the flag begins with
LTDH19 and has an n in it.

Using the same logic throughout the competitor should be able to deduct different parts of the flag.

A little bit of playing around and experimenting may be needed before the competitor find the right place for the characters.

Bellow is a solution.
 
LTDH19{R3g3X_15_4_N000B5}
....1........1...........
..................N......
[A-Z]_1
[A-Z]_[1-9]{2}_
3.3
.{19}000
5.$
B
{R[1-9]g[1-9]
[3-5]_

LTDH19{R3g3X_15_4_N000B5}
