# Discord?
## Solution

This challenge wanted the user to visit the discord. Which there was a link for on the scoreboard.

The trick to solving this challenge was to notice that it didn't redirect you directly but insteasd you visited a page for a second.

if you did `view-source:scoreboard.com/discord` you woulod be able to see the source of the page which you visited.

The flag was hidden there.
