# Image Manipulation 3

## Solution
This challenge requires the user to once again manipulate an image.

In this case they are given a data matrix however the data has been flipped. Therefore black has become white and white has become black.

In this case the border on the left and bottom has stayed the same.

Therefore the competitior has to modify the values whilst still keeping the offset which is the border.

If they do this correctly they will have a completed data matrix and be able to scan it and get the flag.
