# Image Manipulation 1

__Challenge Author: @CuPcakeN1njA__

## Solution
This challenge requires the user to manipulate the image they are given.

This challenge you are given a QR code which is fairly obvious just by looking at it. However it is scewed at an angle.

To fix it the competitor must write the code to unscew the image whichh has an offset by one pixel.
There are multiple ways of finding out there is a one pixel offset, the competitor just has to write the code to unscew the qr code.

Each line will be a set amount of pixels and each of the black parts on the QR code should be a set amount of pixel. The competitor can use this to correct the image.

I have attached my solution script.
