# LeTourDuHack19_Writeups
Writeups for Le Tour Du Hack 2019.

Here I have attempted to do some wrietups for Le Tour Du Hack 2019. They are not extremely in depth due to the large range of challenges that were used in the competition. 

## Overview
In total there were over 65 challenges released in 3 waves throughout the day. We had all categories of challenges from Web to hardware based challenges.

Congratulations to the winning teams and to everyone who competed it was a well fought competition despite some issues with both the scoreboard and some of the challenges.

A big thank you to all those who competed I hope you enjoyed the CTF and will be back next year for Le Tour Du Hack 2020.
